alldone.io
=============

This is the code for my project **alldone.io**, a simple free-to-use hierarchical to-do list. It consists of three parts:

1. A simple PHP minisite to allow account creation, list creation and setting of list permissions (url.php + /code/)
2. A JavaScript and jQuery front-end (output by todo.php).
3. A PHP API that allows the front-end to save and load lists using AJAX (/api_code/).

Insert database credentials into code/pass.php.
