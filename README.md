# alldone.io

This is the code for my project **alldone.io**, a simple free to use hierarchical to-do list. It consists of three parts:

1. A simple PHP minisite to allow account creation, list creation and list permissions (url.php + /code/)
2. A JavaScript and jQuery front-end (output by todo.php).
3. A PHP API that allows the front-end to save and load lists using AJAX (/api_code/).

Insert database credentials into code/pass.php.

This is pretty simple and is here, more than anything, to help me master GitHub :)
